 In life you are already all of you are from IIT So there's a majority chance that you will get placement good companies If you work hard, I think 6 LPK package A placement sale offer is available in any way So majority of you will have a good start in you career I don't want to give you any advice on how to get a good placement package Because you'll figure it out And your seniors have already been told that you will get a placement sale You'll surely get a reward for it So if I had to give an advice That would probably be number one dream wig Do not dream small Don't let a 20 LPK 40 LPK 60 LPK package be your dream Dream bigger than that Now that you're career, don't make it about the first package At least, small size, small size I suggest you to take a vision of 5-7 Don't try to just do something better Try to do something brilliant Try to do something that you can create You can feel better if you have a good start As compared to majority of you, India And I took it at a much higher level That's the reason why I'm doing it Because coming from a premier institution like IIT of 50 LP Package should not be a dream for all of you And this is the reason why we have to give our life You will not get everything Sometimes when we are young, we are very optimistic about achieving everything When we come to college, we will also best of us We will best of us We will best of us, we will be the coolest person in college We will be the best of our career Life can then generally, you will not achieve everything There will always be something that will be solved But if you just decide, you want this one thing from college You want to learn this one thing or you want to get this one thing from life 100% surety is that if you are ready to work towards it, you will get that one thing So you have to decide your first year, second year and the other What is that one thing going to be If you have clarity of your mind, you should know your own things And you work towards it With complete focus by cutting off distractions So nobody can stop you from achieving your dream There is a very famous saying by Steve Jobs But deciding what not to do is as important as deciding what to do And that I think is the biggest learning that I have taken in the past four years Of my career at Upna College Because a lot of times you have to say no to things And you have to start prior, you are targeting that as called mid-choring And that is called being a Dalting Up
