 If the machine could talk so naturally that the interrogator couldn't tell it wasn't human, well wouldn't that be like a sign of thinking on some level? Whoa, that's a pretty big leap. Just because a machine can use words like we do, does that automatically mean it's thinking the same way? Imagine a machine trying to pass this test. It's got to be like some kind of mental Olympian. A mental decathlon from machines. What kind of skills are we talking about here? Well, first off language, right? But not just like spitting out words, it's got to be natural, like, understanding grammar, context, even throwing in some humor, sarcasm, yeah, the whole nine yards. So no more robot voices. It's got to sound like a real conversation. Exactly. And it's not just about talking the talk. It's got to have some reasoning skills, too. Like following an argument, making connections between ideas, answering in a way that makes you think, hey, that makes sense.
